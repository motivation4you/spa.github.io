            <img class="main-image" alt="Blog picture" src="https://www.spaexperience.org.uk/images/default-source/default-album/male-spa-treatment.jpg?sfvrsn=0">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Finding the time to focus on yourself can seem inconceivable for both men and women. However, everyone deserves some time to indulge in being pampered, and spas are the best way to get away from it all and refresh your body.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Increasingly, all men are realising the importance of looking good and feeling good, and many see spas less as an indulgence and more as a health necessity.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>While we are often quick to assume a day at the spa is a women’s activity, this certainly isn’t the case. Men have used spas for decades, centuries even and for the exact reasons as women, to look and feel great.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MEN HAVE ALWAYS VISITED SPAS</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Both men and women have been visiting spas for eons—the idea is certainly nothing new. In fact, spa treatments are one of the oldest practices known to mankind. From the Romans to the ancient Byzantines, humans have always appreciated spas for their health-giving qualities.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img alt="picture" src="https://www.spaexperience.org.uk/images/default-source/default-album/male-massage.jpg?sfvrsn=0">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The idea that spas are just for women is a very modern idea, and one that is starting to change, with men of all ages booking grooming treatments and making their appearance a priority.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>WHAT TREATMENTS CAN MEN GET AT A SPA?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Spa treatments for men, such as the ones offered at Spa Experience, are designed with active men in mind and are designed to allow you to be completely pampered.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>From facials to manicures to waxing, spas are designed to bring you comfort and relaxation and to get you looking your very best…the treatments you choose are entirely up to you.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MALE WAXING</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As all male athletes will tell you, waxing is a safe and reliable way of removing body hair, and as a hair-removal method it is far less irritating than shaving or trimming. On top of that, the effects of waxing last a lot longer, plus you’re not left with unsightly rashes or stubble!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img alt="picture" src="https://www.spaexperience.org.uk/images/default-source/default-album/male-waxing.jpg?sfvrsn=0">
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>SKIN TREATMENTS FOR MEN</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>If you’ve been burning the candle at both ends lately and dread looking in the mirror in the morning, a skin-energising facial massage treatment may just be the cure you need.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Not only is Elemis High Performance Skin Energiser supremely relaxing, it also works wonders on tired and worn skin and eyes as it maximises cell regeneration, leaving you with younger, fresher, toned skin.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MANICURES FOR MEN</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Whether you know it or not, your hands tell a tale about who you are. Bitten nails suggest you’re a nervous person, rough hands suggest you just don’t care, and dirt under your nails…well, let’s just say that they won’t go unnoticed in a business meeting.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img alt="picture" src="https://www.spaexperience.org.uk/images/default-source/default-album/male-manicure.jpg?sfvrsn=0">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>So, if you want to nail a good first impression, book a manicure! Far from being decadent, this simple treatment will keep your hands and nails groomed and well maintained. And, as it’s a quick treatment, you can easily fit it in on the way home from work.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MALE PEDICURES</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>If your feet are more hobbit than handsome, it may be time for a relaxing pedicure, especially if you’re about to go on your holidays and show off your feet.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>During a pedicure, not only are your nails buffed to perfection, your feet are scrubbed to remove all traces of dead, dry skin, then gently massaged. You’ll be left feeling relaxed and wondering why you didn’t do this sooner!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>CAN MEN VISIT A SPA ANYTIME?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>It’s always recommended to book your spa treatment in advance. Men can visit any Spa Experience location during mixed session times. It’s best to clarify with the individual Spa when these sessions are.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>SO, GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Now that you know what to expect from a spa visit, why not book an appointment? Spa Experience offers a range of spa treatments designed specifically for men, all of which offer a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Not only will you be left looking polished and groomed, you’ll also feel rejuvenated and renewed and ready to take on the world once more!</p>
