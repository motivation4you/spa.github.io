            <img class="main-image" alt="Blog picture" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544161515-4ab6ce6db874?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>If you haven’t yet heard of hammam, you are bound to soon. This treatment makes itself known around the world for being a relaxing and cleansing Moroccan ritual that is centuries old.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Hammam differs slightly from the traditional thermal spa. While both are profoundly relaxing and good for the skin, rather than using thermal waters, hammam treatments use hot steam to encourage a deep and invigorating cleanse.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Many hammam treatments also use vitamin-E rich, olive-based soap known for its skin-nourishing and exfoliating properties. Additionally, some treatments may include rhassoul clay, an antibacterial mineral that effectively and safely removes toxins and impurities from the body, reduces sebum and tightens pores.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>THE ART OF BATHING</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The tradition of bathing is an integral part of Middle Eastern and North African culture, often taking place in beautiful old bath-houses. Bathing is as much a place to gather and talk, as it is a place to relax and clean yourself.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img alt="picture" src="https://www.spaexperience.org.uk/images/default-source/default-album/hammam-bathca702a43ec86691782d0ff00001f97d9.jpg?sfvrsn=0">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Two of the most common types of baths are the Moroccan hammam and the Turkish bath. While both are popular, the Moroccan hammam is often favoured because of its use of steam over water. Steam does wonders for softening skin, relaxing the mind, and opening the pores for a deep cleansing experience.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>THE HISTORY OF THE HAMMAM</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The first public bath was created by the Roman Empire more than 2000 years ago . As with traditional hammam baths, Roman baths featured rooms of varying temperatures. This way, it was possible to stimulate the circulation as well as detoxify the body by sweating out impurities, ensuring a deep cleanse.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The concept of the public bath caught on with the rest of the world shortly after, with Morocco as one of the first countries to embrace this way of bathing. Citizens approved of the way they were able to keep themselves clean and their skin nourished, all while being able to sit and chat with their neighbours.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Today the hammam bath is still highly prevalent in Moroccan culture, with many Moroccans attending baths weekly.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>WHAT TO BRING TO A HAMMAM?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Previously, genders in hammam baths were separated. However, it’s now more common for unisex treatments, so you may want to bring a bathrobe, bikini/ swimsuit, and flip-flops to your hammam treatment to protect your privacy.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
